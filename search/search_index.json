The system replaces physical handles with sensor based actuation allowing users to open and close doors hands free. The project is divided into four main subsystems: motor, IR sensors, flex sensor, and rotary encoder. My subsystem (Rotary Encoder) tracks the angular position of the door and relays this information to the microcontroller so it can coordinate with the other components.</p> </li> <li> <p>To view how all subsystems integrate and communicate, visit our full team report.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<ul> <li>This needs to be updated to reflect a team introduction</li> <li>Content should also help an unfamiliar reader navigate to areas of interest.
